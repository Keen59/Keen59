 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Keen's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
In 2016, I began my software development journey in high school, where I honed my skills in database operations and developed automation programs. However, it was in 2018, during my high school internship, that I had my first encounter with Unity, igniting my passion for game development. Since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering various aspects of this craft. I am highly skilled in object-oriented programming (OOP), utilizing its principles to create robust and efficient code. Unity, both in 2D and 3D, has become my primary tool for game development, allowing me to bring my creative visions to life. I am well-versed in game design patterns, leveraging them to enhance gameplay mechanics and create immersive experiences. One of my areas of expertise lies in network and server systems. I have gained proficiency in implementing multiplayer functionality, enabling players to connect, interact, and enjoy games together. The challenge of building multiplayer games excites me, and I am driven to create engaging and dynamic online experiences. Adaptability is a key trait that I possess, allowing me to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and frameworks. I am self-motivated, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills. When it comes to my work, I am committed to delivering high-quality results, ensuring that every aspect of my projects meets or exceeds expectations. Ethics play a significant role in my professional approach. I prioritize integrity, honesty, and fairness in all my endeavors. Colleagues and collaborators can rely on me to be sincere and transparent throughout the development process. I take pride in being a reliable team member, consistently meeting deadlines and fulfilling commitments. With a diverse skill set and a genuine passion for game development, I am ready to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what is possible. My dedication to delivering top-notch work, coupled with my ethical and reliable nature, sets me apart as a game developer who is poised to make a meaningful impact.
